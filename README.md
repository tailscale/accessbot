# Request Access

This automation features an access request workflow where users can create a
request (with details) that is routed to another user to approve or deny.

When approved, the workflow will assign a custom device posture attribute to the
requester's device.

## Setup

Before getting started, first make sure you have a development workspace where
you have permission to install apps. **Please note that the features in this
project require that the workspace be part of
[a Slack paid plan](https://slack.com/pricing).**

### Install the Slack CLI

To use this sample, you need to install and configure the Slack CLI.
Step-by-step instructions can be found in our
[Quickstart Guide](https://api.slack.com/automation/quickstart).

### Configuration

Configure your access profiles in `config.json`. You can see configuration
schema in `types/config.ts`.

Create an OAuth client in Tailscale with the `devices:write` scope. For running
locally, put your OAuth client credentials into the `.env` file. In production,
configure the same variables using `slack env` commands after deploying, e.g.

```bash
slack env add TAILSCALE_CLIENT_ID ...
slack env add TAILSCALE_CLIENT_SECRET ..
```

## Running Your Project Locally

While building your app, you can see your changes appear in your workspace in
real-time with `slack run`. You'll know an app is the development version if the
name has the string `(local)` appended.

```zsh
# Run app locally
$ slack run

Connected, awaiting events
```

To stop running locally, press `<CTRL> + C` to end the process.

## Deploying Your App

Once development is complete, deploy the app to Slack infrastructure using
`slack deploy`:

```zsh
$ slack deploy
```

When deploying for the first time, you'll be prompted to
[create a new link trigger](#creating-triggers) for the deployed version of your
app. When that trigger is invoked, the workflow should run just as it did when
developing locally (but without requiring your server to be running).

## Viewing Activity Logs

Activity logs of your application can be viewed live and as they occur with the
following command:

```zsh
$ slack activity --tail
```

## Project Structure

### `.slack/`

Contains `apps.dev.json` and `apps.json`, which include installation details for
development and deployed apps.

### `datastores/`

[Datastores](https://api.slack.com/automation/datastores) securely store data
for your application on Slack infrastructure. Required scopes to use datastores
include `datastore:write` and `datastore:read`.

### `functions/`

[Functions](https://api.slack.com/automation/functions) are reusable building
blocks of automation that accept inputs, perform calculations, and provide
outputs. Functions can be used independently or as steps in workflows.

### `triggers/`

[Triggers](https://api.slack.com/automation/triggers) determine when workflows
are run. A trigger file describes the scenario in which a workflow should be
run, such as a user pressing a button or when a specific event occurs.

### `workflows/`

A [workflow](https://api.slack.com/automation/workflows) is a set of steps
(functions) that are executed in order.

Workflows can be configured to run without user input or they can collect input
by beginning with a [form](https://api.slack.com/automation/forms) before
continuing to the next step.

### `manifest.ts`

The [app manifest](https://api.slack.com/automation/manifest) contains the app's
configuration. This file defines attributes like app name and description.

### `slack.json`

Used by the CLI to interact with the project's SDK dependencies. It contains
script hooks that are executed by the CLI and implemented by the SDK.
